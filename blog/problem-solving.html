          <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
          <h2>Blocked on a simple problem</h2>
          <h3></h3>
          <p>
            During one of the coding session we were asked to find the replaced
            all the word “Buzz” regardless of its case sensitive. After a couple
            of tried I manage to crack the code by replacing all the different
            case sensitive word “Buzz” but was stuck with the last change which
            was the actual word “buzz”, I continued to research and read up on
            replacement codes that could help me. Not knowing I had the answer
            all along and just needed to add an extra step to replace the word.
            While trying to figure out this question I kept console.log-ing,
            which is printing out the value and to be able to see where I was
            getting. This helped me understand where I was at and which step I
            needed to continue to solve the question.
          </p>

          <h2>Solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>
          <h3></h3>
          <p>
            It was during the question that asked us to find the average value.
            I made the method of pseudocode and list out the steps I needed to
            take to obtain my answers. I manage to flow through step by step and
            got the answer required. It was a little excitement with I “pass”
            that statement. What I learn from this was to understand the steps
            and to execute it base on logic.

          <h2>Problem solving techniques and process</h2>
          <h3>• Pseudocode</h3>
          <p>
            I really like this method, as it helps me plan the flow and thought
            process of coding. It helps me when I get stuck to try to work my
            way down. I guess this is something I do on a daily basis when I
            plan to cook, checking my ingredient and to prep the food
            accordingly.
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <h3>• Trying something</h3>
          <p>
            During the challenges, I usually just try something at the start and
            depending on what the results return. Sometime its correct and I
            move on to to trying the next, other times when an error message
            shows I will try to work them out.
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <h3>• Rubber ducky method</h3>
          <p>
            Recently I realised I have been reading and speaking about my
            problem out loud and by doing that I was able to pin point my issue
            and slowing it. The rubber ducky method is a great way to analyse
            the problem.
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <h3>• Reading error messages</h3>
          <p>
            I am still learning to read error messages and understanding the
            analogy of each term. But the error message for syntax error is a
            great help to me for making my code work.
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <h3>• Console.logging</h3>
          <p>
            Prior to Week 4 we were introduced to console.loging. But during
            week 4 sprint I have new found love for console.logging. It shows me
            where Im at and where I’m needed to move forward with the code. Just
            by coding you don’t actual know if you are on the right path,
            whereas with console.logging you get to see what is printed out and
            if you are on the right track.
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <h3>• Googling</h3>
          <p>
            This is by far the most used and one of the most efficient way. I
            literally google everything and would make it an effort to do for
            awhile before I seek help with a problem.
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <h3>• Asking your peers for help</h3>
          <p>
            I need to work on this. At times when Im stuck I’m not sure what the
            problems is, therefore its is hard for me to ask a questions not
            knowing what my questions is. This is def something Im trying,
            asking for help when needed.
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <h3>• Asking coaches for help</h3>
          <p>
            The coaches are wonderful with their insight and understanding. I’m
            comfortable asking them for help and helping me with my problems.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h3>• Improving your process with reflection</h3>
          <p>
            I have yet to properly sit down and reflect on my problems or
            mistake, as I tend to just try to finish through the challenges and
            complete them. It would be something I would like to work on it and
            do more. This would def benefit me in the future.
