          <h3><em>Why do we use them differently?</em></h3>
          <p>
            <strong>IDs</strong> - they are use for item that are single
            elements (eg. header or footer). In another word you can identify
            them as <em>unique</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Classes</strong> - are use for item that repeats (eg.
            paragraph, buttons or links). They can be applied to more than one
            element.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another note to look out is that a HTML element can have both an id
            or a class.

          <h2>Margin vs Padding vs Border</h2>
          <h3>Why do we use them differently</h3>
          <p>
            In CSS Coding world when we need to align a certain image, text or
            item you will come across hearing these words
            <em>margin, padding or border</em>. But what do they mean? On a
            webpage, they are segregated into different sections shown below.
          </p>
          <p class="aligncenter">
            <img
              src="/images/contentcopy.png"
              width="400"
              height="200"
              alt="centered image"
            />
          </p>

          <h3>Margin</h3>
          <p>
            Margin is the space around an element's border. In a simple form the
            margin property controls the space outside the element. When we
            write <em>margin : 10px;</em> it means that there will be 10 pixels
            space between the element and adjacent page element. The margin also
            pushes its neighboring elements which allows them to have some room
            to breath.
          </p>

          <h3>Padding</h3>
          <p>
            As for padding, it is located inside the border of an element to
            generate space. In order to create a gap the padding either grows
            the element's size or shrinks the content.
          </p>

          <h3>Border</h3>
          <p>
            Border surrounds the elements that can be modified in various ways
            like solid, dashed or even rounded corners.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              In short, margin is the space around an element's border, padding
              is the space between an element's border.</em
