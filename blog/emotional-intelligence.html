          <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence</h2>
          <p>
            Sensitivity to the mood of other and the capabilities to understand a significant issue that may be going on behind. Able to analyse an outburst is an actual sign of a plea instead of anger or frustration.  Contrastingly a person that may seem extremely happy on the outside may be sentimentally disavowed. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Emotional Intelligence is a way we interpret ourselves, and how our emotions appears. It comes from many factors that forms each of our own emotional intelligence. Our culture and childhood to me is a huge part as it somehow a core which could eventually mould us to who we are today. </p>

          <h2>How is it different to IQ</h2>
          <p>
            Intelligence Quotient is all about logic, and execute any functions that is being tasked. Like a program, where they will have bad days and decides “You know what, today seems like a bad day, I not run the command”. 
            IQ does not require emotions and will do what deem to be a more logical approach and answer. The difference with EQ is it takes into consideration of the person's limitations, and evaluates it base on each individual capabilities. 


          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
          <p>
            They both important and really come hand in hand. When you have great emotional intelligence you can interpret a situation well, and it works vice versa. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We all need a certain level of EQ and IQ to bring us further. With good IQ we are competent in our educations, our skills, or even work delivery. However if we have a good EQ, it could mean good social skills, understanding someone else or team mate better. This could really help us evaluate further on what need to be done to make present the project well.
