          <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence</h2>
          <p>
            Sensitivity to the mood of other and the capabilities to understand a significant issue that may be going on behind. Able to analyse an outburst is an actual sign of a plea instead of anger or frustration.  Contrastingly a person that may seem extremely happy on the outside may be sentimentally disavowed. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Emotional Intelligence is a way we interpret ourselves, and how our emotions appears. It comes from many factors that forms each of our own emotional intelligence. Our culture and childhood to me is a huge part as it somehow a core which could eventually mould us to who we are today. </p>

          <h2>How is it different to IQ</h2>
          <p>
            IQ is all about logic, and execute any functions that is being tasked. Like a program, where they will have bad days and decides “You know what, today seems like a bad day, I not run the command”. 

          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
          <p>
            They both important and really come hand in hand. When you have great emotional intelligence you can interpret a situation well, and it works vice versa.
