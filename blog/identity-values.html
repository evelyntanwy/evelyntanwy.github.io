          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I was born and raised in Malaysia</p>
          <p>
            I then left to Australia for studies and was living and working
            there for a number of years. Eventually decided to move back to Asia
            - Singapore to be closer to family and friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            After working there for 2 years, I decided to embark on a new
            journey in New Zealand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like that 4.5 years went by and I am extremely grateful to live
            in such a wonderful country and call
            <strong>New Zealand</strong> my home.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am an Engineer by profession and had been working as a Systems
            Engineer maintaining the Wellington trains before I decided to take
            a leap of faith to start this exciting journey with
            <strong><em>Dev Academy</em></strong
            >.

          <h1>Identity Values</h1>
          <h2>Values and Passion</h2>
          <h3>Respect, Responsibilities and Kindness</h3>
          <p>These values has always grew with me since I was little.</p>
          <p>
            Over the years living in different countries and meeting different
            people has made me realised the importance of
            <em><strong>respecting</strong></em> others. As cliche as it sounds,
            it might not mean much to us, but would mean everything to someone
            else by treating them with respect.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em><strong>Responsibilities</strong></em> is also a value I try to
            instill. We have to be responsible in accepting the path we made and
            to take charge on how we want them to form.
          </p>

          <p>
            A little bit of <em><strong>kindness</strong></em> goes a long way.
            We do not know what others are going through. Just a simple gesture
            could change their life.
          </p>

          <h3>How my culture has influenced my values and identity</h3>
          <p>
            I would say growing up in Malaysia was wonderful. Malaysia is a
            multi racial country which consist of three major races, (Malay,
            Chinese and Indian). This has widely shape my values to understand
            the different culture of different families. I learn to be more
            accepting and respectful, by understanding the traditions and
            certain struggles of each different lifestyle. We have also a
            relatively laid back culture, which lead to a less stressful
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we meet a friend we don't start by asking "How's your day?"
            instead we ask them "Have you eaten?" I guess due to it's diversity,
            we manage to find a common topic that could be relatable to everyone
            which is food. This had then cultivated into my life and only in
            recent years I have found my new love for cooking and baking. The
            feeling of preparing a wonderful meal and putting food on the table
            has made me feel blessed and thankful.

          <h3>
            Describe your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning
          </h3>
          <p>
            My strengths would be diligence, when I put my heart into a certain
            task I will try to give my all to complete the task with my best
            efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for my limitations, I occasionally take a longer time to
            completed certain task or to grasp the concept of it.
          </p>

          <h3>A situation where I had to make an ethical decision.</h3>
          <p>
            To be honest this is a hard question to answer, we make ethical
            decision on a daily basic. There won't be a right or a wrong answer
            but what will make you go home and be at peace with your decision.
            When I encounter this sort situation I put myself in the person shoe
            and thinking about what I would rather received and decide them
            accordingly.
