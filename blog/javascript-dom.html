      <h1>Javascript Fundamentals</h1>
      <h2>HTML, CSS and Javascript</h2>
      <h3></h3>
      <p>
        Think of it as a new build house on a section. <em>HTML</em> acts as an
        <strong>Engineer</strong>. They will need to understand the idea and
        concept of the website that is being build. They determine the
        structural integrity of the building. As for <em>CSS</em> it would be
        the <strong>Architect</strong>, that helps bring the idea to life and
        the vision of the house with colours and patterns.
        <em> Javascript</em> comes in to play as the
        <strong>Interior Designer</strong> which helps your make your house
        fancy, cosy and even smart. Fitting in different buttons and sections
        that needs bit of sprucing up.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <br />
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <h3></h3>
      <p>
        Think of it as buying a furniture piece, the instructions manual that
        guide you on how to build the items into a useful piece. When you follow
        through the instructions you get the furniture you wanted. Which implies
        to a website, when the <em>functions</em> are build we get a functional
        website that is interactive.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <br />
      <h2>Control flow, loops, array, objects</h2>
      <h3></h3>
      <p>
        <em>Control flow</em> literal explanations would be controlling the
        flow, and in another word telling your computer the steps you want them
        to perform. If we go back to the idea of purchasing a furniture, the
        different section of the manual acts as the control flow, (eg, for top
        section please turn to page 12).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Loops</em> acts as factor repeating the process on different
        section. As for the objects they represent the parts that puts the
        furniture in place such as the MDF board.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Array</em> is the container that stores a number of items, such as
        the screw, wooden dowel and at times you might be lucky you get a mini
        allen key.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <br />
      <h2>DOM and DevTools</h2>
      <h3></h3>
      <p>
        <em>DOM</em> is like the cloud manual can be accessible when needed. If
        ever lost it just ask google
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>DevTools</em> would represent a supervisor inspecting your work as
        you go along building your item.
      </p>
      <p></p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- 
- Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
- Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
- Explain what functions are and why they are useful. -->
