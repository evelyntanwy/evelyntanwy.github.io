          <h2>What is Neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p>
            Neuroplaticity is an ability for our brain to reorganize that form a new neural connections which occurs in our lifetime. It allows our nerve cells in the brain to redevelop from any injury or diseases that could help in the responses. Apart from that the responses to every new situations or to adapt in a change environment. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Neuroplaticity can occur by physically rewiring ourself, in which by changing our mindset though practices.  </p>
          <p>“You cause your brain to change physically and make a neural connection”</p>
        
          <p></p>
          <h2>How does it benefit people?</h2>
          <p>
            I love a saying by C.S Lewis - “You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.”
          </p>
          <p>A lot of us including myself would be too afraid to start something thinking that we will not succeed before even trying. But the first step is always to try and do something. With the right mindset and courage it will bring us a step closer. Having to understand the meaning of neuroplaticity could help us change our mindset and to work towards our goal. With that comes practicing and mould our responses with different situations.</p>
          <p></p>
          <h2>How I benefit the principles of neuroplaticity</h2>
          <p>
            Setting the right mindset and to curate a good plan. As we are encouraged to practice, practice, practice. This will eventually build a muscle memory that could help in the process of this journey. Its okay to be not okay. There would be struggles and I will need to view them as the journey, because its the part and parcel of the learning journey. 
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h2>Ways to increase neuroplaticity</h2>
          <p>
            Having a good routine, helps your train in situations. I’m trying to play more games. I think it helps me keep active and to learn something new. I'm not the best person at games, I tend to die in any game so by simulating my brain in games trying to keep alive. 
            Lastly also to learn a new skills, using a language that you used to be good because language is also an expect that need practicing. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
          <p>
            The meaning of growth mindset is celebrate trying, learn a new skill of learning, effort is a journey to a brighter life
            Growth mindset is finding joy in learning regardless of age, time and outcome. Of course we all want to succeed but sometime we get so caught up in how we want the end go to be and forget the process of it. Having growth mindset helps you celebrate trying, no matter the outcome you have try doing it and it is worth celebrating. We need to put in effort to build the journey in order for a brighter life.

          <h2>Did anything surprise you or change you?
        </h2>
          <p>
            We are never too old to learn, trying it today would be better than doing it tomorrow, in 5 years time or even in 10 years. So don’t let anything stop you for getting out of the comfort zone and trying something new. Taking the first step of trying and doing it, it’s already wonderful growth mindset. 
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <h2>integrating growth mindset into your learning journey</h2>
          <p>
            Joining Dev Academy during this time has made me realise the importance of growth mindset. Because once you put your heart to you, trust the process and enjoy the learning process. Prior to applying for Dev Academy, I wasn’t sure if I could make it, but as we enter week 4 going on Week 5, it is definitely challenging, but what is not right? So allowing myself to feel this process, take time to reflect when I feel overwhelmed and frustrated. Giving myself the assurance that “I can do it whatever it takes regardless of time”. You just need to put your heart into it and push through. 
          </p>
