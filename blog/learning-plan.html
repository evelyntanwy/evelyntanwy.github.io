          <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
          <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2> 
          <p>I would desire to be a competent web developer. With this new skills I hope that a job will not just become a job but a passion that I love. 
            Joining a organization that values the employee and a work life balance. I will then be able to use my non work hours in doing things I love. I have always had a keen interest with children with special needs and aged care. With my new skills I hope that I can help them one way or another.

          <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2> 
          <p>• Confidence</p>
          <p>Throughout my career I have always been asked to be more confident, this has been a struggle for me as a woman in a male dominated industry.
            As a matter of fact, I am also small in stature and always needed to proved my abilities with my work. But I am very grateful to have met good mentors along the way that have believed in my skills. From this journey I hope to be more open and confident with myself.

            Celebrate the small achievements and create realistic daily goals for myself. Reassess myself on a regular basis to check on how things are progressing.
