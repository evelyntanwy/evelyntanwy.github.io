          <h2>End of Foundations</h2>
          <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2> 
          <p>Come out as a better and more competent web developer. I would like to combine both my skills (current and new - web development) and be able to help people in a way. As cliche as it sounds, I do wish my job involve something that is meaningful and could be a valuable asset. I would like to join a company that I share the same passion with. Also help me grow as a person and be able to use my skill wisely. Transitioning to the tech world, this can broaden the scope and not specifically in New Zealand but else where if needed.

          </p>
          <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
          <p>I don’t think they have changed much, I mention my strengths is diligence, and I do see how it helped me pull though Foundations. At times when it got difficult I was diligent to read up more and practice  more trying to solve the problem. </p>
          <p>As for my limitations, based on the time boxing there were task that I did spend longer. But there was also task that I manage to spend less time with better understanding. I don’t think it would hinder my bootcamp journey, but to understand my limits and capabilities by working harder on topics that need more understanding. 
          </p>
          <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
          <p>Keeping focus. At times when you start looking into an issue, and tend to go down a rabbit hole looking into other issue and not solving the first issue. Taking it a step at a time and try to rectify them according. 
          </p>
          <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
          <p>To improve my confidence with my work and self. Also be and be able to communicate with others well. This will def help with the atmosphere without any added stress. </p>
          <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
          <p>I hope the team will guide me in a right direction and to work on my weakness to better improve as a web developer. Helping me when self doubt comes in play and to assist me with a bit a push and hint when I’m not quite going the right way (in codes).
          </p>

          <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
          <p>During the studying period to fully concentrate and not be distracted. Try as hard as I can and to be fully committed to coding and completing the task. Try to take some breaks even tho I have not solved the problem. Asking for help when needed or when google is not showing me the correct way. </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Start of Foundations</h2>
          <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2> 
          <p>I would desire to be a competent web developer. With this new skills I hope that a job will not just become a job but a passion that I love. 
            Joining a organization that values the employee and a work life balance. I will then be able to use my non work hours in doing things I love. I have always had a keen interest with children with special needs and aged care. With my new skills I hope that I can help them one way or another.

          <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2> 
          <p>• Confidence</p>
          <p>Throughout my career I have always been asked to be more confident, this has been a struggle for me as a woman in a male dominated industry.
            As a matter of fact, I am also small in stature and always needed to proved my abilities with my work. But I am very grateful to have met good mentors along the way that have believed in my skills. From this journey I hope to be more open and confident with myself.
