          <h1>Core Reflection</h1>
          <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        </h2>
          <p>
            Learning is a process. It takes time, energy, commitment and support from family. Having committed to learning and pushing to your limits to achieve your goal. Having great support from family is surely a great bonus to ease these time.</p>
          <p>Nothing comes easy, how much effort you put in will produce the same amount. No input no output. You will not wake up the next day if you don’t put the time and energy towards it.
        </p>
        <p>Ability to accept mistakes and learn from them instead of ruminating over it. Try to work on it and understand the mistake. This will help you prevent having the same mistake and look at it in another point of view. 
        </p>
            
          <p></p>
          <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
          <p>
            Be <strong>kind</strong> to yourself and others. At times I am so annoyed at myself for not understanding a certain logic or concept. Programming its hard and not getting straight off is probably normal but just the frustrations def gets to you. That being said, have empathy to others as they too are probably feeling similar, better or worst. We won’t know what others are feeling so don’t be too quick to judge.</p>
          <p><strong>Self-awareness</strong> of how you are feeling and how you are coping. Work on your own timing and own abilities. Not comparing with others as we all come from different background and different live journey. So set your own timeline and goals. </p>
            
          <p></p>
          <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
          <p>
            To actually use the concept and execute it during the learning process. I really love the mindset part. It kept me grounded and just try to set a good and positive mindset and pull through the course. It was hard not gonna lie but if not for the mindset it would have been whole lot harder. </p>
            

          <p></p>
          <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
          <p>
            I think every week had a different challenge in a way. The first week we had to introduce to the foundation group about yourself. Having to introduce to people physically was sometimes daunting what more virtually and people you have never met before apart from their profile pictures. But then once you do that it not that scary after all. Then we had the pair programming and a couple of others. These was great after completing them and you do see the benefit of them having to hear from others.</p>

          <p></p>
          <h2>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
          <p>
            To develop yourself and have a better understanding about yourself and others. We will eventually have to work with other one way or another soon. 
</p>
          <p>While in my work previously, we always joke that the people are the reason you go to work (I am apart from doing your actual work) and people are also the reason you don’t want to go to work. These core practices has made me learn a lot more and be able to see it in another way when I return back to the working world later on.</p>
            
          <p></p>

          <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
          <p>
            I don’t think it is its a waste of time. It was actually very good, and I found it very useful. I manage to use them during the studies as well. There was a lot of concepts that I knew but never actually worked on it or even use it prior to starting foundations. I believe moulding someone soft skills is a great and we don’t get that chance very often. So I do love the core part of this studies. </p>
