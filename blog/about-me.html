          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I was born and raised in Malaysia</p>
          <p>
            I then left to Australia for studies and was living and working
            there for a number of years. Eventually decided to move back to Asia
            - Singapore to be closer to family and friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            After working there for 2 years, I decided to embark on a new
            journey in New Zealand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like that 4.5 years went by and I am extremely grateful to live
            in such a wonderful country and call
            <strong>New Zealand</strong> my home.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am an Engineer by profession and had been working as a Systems
            Engineer maintaining Wellington trains before I decided to take a
            leap of faith to start this exciting journey with
            <strong>Enspiral Dev Academy (EDA)</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Venturing into the tech space has made me realise the endless
            possibilities of creating and building things. Over the past couple
            of months I have cultivated the appreciation for coding when it
            dawned on me that I could automate a lot of the busy work in my life
          </p>

          <p>
            Times when I'm not coding, you will most likely find me behind a
            sewing machine trying to making something. I find the simple joy of
            turning a large piece of fabric into a beautiful piece.
