          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I was born and raised in Malaysia</p>
          <p>
            I then left to Australia for studies and was living and working
            there for a number of years. Eventually decided to move back to Asia
            - Singapore to be closer to family and friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            After working there for 2 years, I decided to embark on a new
            journey in New Zealand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like that 4.5 years went by and I am extremely grateful to live
            in such a wonderful country and call
            <strong>New Zealand</strong> my home.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am an Engineer by profession and had been working as a Systems
            Engineer maintaining Wellington trains before I decided to take a
            leap of faith to start this exciting journey with
            <strong><em>Dev Academy</em></strong
            >.

          <h2>Values and Passion</h2>
          <h3>Respect, Responsibilities and Kindness</h3>
          <p>These values has always grew with me since I was little.</p>
          <p>
            Over the years living in different countries and meeting different
            people has made me realised the importance of
            <em>respecting</em> others. As cliche as it sounds, it might not
            mean much to us, but would mean everything to someone else by
            treating them with respect.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Responsibilities</em> is also a value I try to instill. We have
            to be responsible in accepting the path we made and to take charge
            on how we want them to form.
          </p>

          <p>
            A little bit of <em>kindness</em> goes a long way. We do not know
            what others are going through. Just a simple gesture could change
            their life.
